Introduction: Sequence Mutation
===============================

The build further on sequences, the following chapter will detail more of the methods that can be used. 
Additionally, you will learn more about how objects are treated in Python, and how they can change!

Learning Goals
--------------

* To understand the concepts of mutable and immutable data types
* To understand that methods on strings leave the origninal string alone but return a new string
* To understand that lists are mutable data types and that mutating methods on lists return None

Objectives
----------

Demonstrate the correct use of:

* concatenate
* index operator
* substring (slice)
* search - contains in / not in and index
* find method
* append
* join
* split
